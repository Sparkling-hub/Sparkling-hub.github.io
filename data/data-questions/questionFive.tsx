    <p>
        Our fees are flat monthly rates determined by the engineerâ€™s level and required skill sets.
        We occasionally offer single developers, but also know that a minimum team of 2-3
        engineers works best and our bundle team packages often offer better value anyways. Feel
        free to contact us to know our rates, no strings attached.
